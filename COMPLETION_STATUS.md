## 🚨 Critical Issues for Agent Work

### Immediate Fixes Required
1. **Fix Jest Configuration**: Change `moduleNameMapping` to `moduleNameMapper`
2. **Fix Activity Tracking Tests**: File filtering logic is broken
3. **Implement Missing ActivityTracker Methods**: File filtering not working properly
4. **Add Error Handling**: Better error boundaries and logging

### High Priority Development
1. **Dashboard Webview**: HTML/CSS/JS dashboard for session insights
2. **Flow State Algorithm**: Implement keystroke velocity and focus analysis
3. **Database Schema Enhancement**: Add tables for analytics and insights
4. **Configuration UI**: Settings page for extension preferences

### Medium Priority Features
1. **Advanced Metrics**: Lines of code, function complexity, file switching
2. **Insights Engine**: Pattern recognition in coding behavior
3. **Team Features**: Session sharing and team analytics
4. **Export/Import**: Data portability for users

## 📊 Current State Assessment

**Functional MVP**: ⚠️ Partially working but test failures indicate core issues
- Session tracking works but may miss activities
- Commands are registered but limited functionality
- No dashboard for viewing insights
- Testing reveals significant gaps in core functionality

**Commercial MVP**: ❌ Needs substantial work (3-4 weeks)
- Dashboard is essential for user value
- Flow state detection is key differentiator
- Team features required for B2B sales
- Payment integration needed for revenue

## 🎯 Immediate Actions for Agents

### Week 1: Fix Core Issues
1. **Fix all failing tests** - critical for reliability
2. **Implement dashboard webview** - core user experience
3. **Complete activity tracking** - ensure accurate data collection
4. **Add comprehensive error handling**

### Week 2: Flow State & Analytics  
1. **Implement flow state detection algorithm**
2. **Build analytics calculation engine**
3. **Create insights generation system**
4. **Add data visualization components**

### Week 3: Team & Monetization
1. **Add team collaboration features**
2. **Implement usage tracking and limits**
3. **Integrate Stripe for subscriptions**
4. **Polish UI and user experience**

## 🔧 Technical Debt

- Test suite needs fixing before any new development
- Error handling is insufficient
- Database migrations not implemented
- Performance optimization needed for activity tracking
- Extension publishing workflow not set up

The extension has a solid foundation but requires significant work to be production-ready and commercially viable.
