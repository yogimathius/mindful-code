# Mindful Code - Requirements

## Introduction

Mindful Code is a programming session tracker with flow state optimization designed to help developers improve focus, reduce burnout, and optimize their coding sessions. The tool targets the 28M developers who struggle with focus and burnout, providing insights into their coding patterns and suggestions for maintaining flow state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Coding Session Tracking

2. WHEN I'm actively typing or navigating code THEN the system SHALL record this as active coding time
3. WHEN I'm idle for more than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL pause the session timer
4. WHEN I resume coding THEN the system SHALL automatically restart the session timer
5. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL save session data including duration, files worked on, and activity level

### Requirement 2: Flow State Detection

**User Story:** As a developer seeking optimal performance, I want the system to detect when I'm in flow state, so that I can understand what conditions help me achieve deep focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm coding continuously without interruption THEN the system SHALL detect potential flow state periods
2. WHEN measuring flow indicators THEN the system SHALL track typing rhythm, file switching frequency, and error rates
3. WHEN flow state is detected THEN the system SHALL record environmental factors like time of day and session length
4. WHEN analyzing flow patterns THEN the system SHALL identify optimal conditions for entering flow state
5. IF flow state is interrupted THEN the system SHALL log the interruption type and duration
### 
Requirement 3: Productivity Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer wanting to improve, I want a dashboard showing my coding patterns and productivity metrics, so that I can make data-driven decisions about my work habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display daily, weekly, and monthly coding statistics
2. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL show total coding time, flow state duration, and productivity scores
3. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL highlight peak productivity hours and optimal session lengths
4. WHEN reviewing data THEN the system SHALL provide insights about break timing and focus sustainability
5. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL show trends and improvements over time

### Requirement 4: Focus Optimization Suggestions

**User Story:** As a developer struggling with focus, I want personalized suggestions for improving my coding sessions, so that I can maintain better concentration and reduce fatigue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes my patterns THEN it SHALL provide personalized recommendations for session timing
2. WHEN I'm approaching fatigue THEN the system SHALL suggest break timing based on my historical data
3. WHEN starting a session THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal environment settings based on past flow states
4. WHEN productivity drops THEN the system SHALL suggest techniques for regaining focus
5. WHEN planning work THEN the system SHALL recommend task scheduling based on my energy patterns

### Requirement 5: Team Analytics (Premium)

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want aggregated team productivity insights, so that I can help optimize our collective development process and identify burnout risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team members opt-in THEN the system SHALL aggregate anonymized productivity metrics
2. WHEN viewing team data THEN the system SHALL show collective flow state patterns and optimal collaboration times
3. WHEN analyzing team health THEN the system SHALL identify potential burnout indicators across team members
4. WHEN planning sprints THEN the system SHALL provide data-driven recommendations for task distribution
5. IF burnout risks are detected THEN the system SHALL alert team leads with suggested interventions

### Requirement 6: Privacy and Data Control

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious developer, I want full control over my data and tracking preferences, so that I can use the tool without compromising my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the extension THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what data is collected and how it's used
2. WHEN configuring tracking THEN the system SHALL allow me to exclude specific projects or file types
3. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL provide options to export or delete all my tracking data
4. WHEN sharing team data THEN the system SHALL only include anonymized metrics with explicit consent
5. IF I opt out THEN the system SHALL immediately stop all data collection and provide local-only functionality

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

1. **Response Time**: Extension SHALL respond to user actions within 100ms
2. **Resource Usage**: Extension SHALL consume less than 50MB RAM during active use
